🧠 My Productivity System: Work-Life Balance with Obsidian + Syncthing

This documnets my journey to build a **work-life balance system** that helps me stay productive despite working a night shift job (6PM–3AM).

> 💡 I use Obsidian, Syncthing, and open-source tools to manage my tasks, goals, and learning across Ubuntu, Windows, and Android — fully offline, fully private.

🔧 Why I Built This

As someone passionate about tech, DevOps, and self-growth, I wanted a system that:

- ✅ Works across my platforms
- ✅ Helps me balance work + learning
- ✅ Doesn't depend on cloud storage
- ✅ Is simple, fast, and in my control

📂 Folder Structure

Here's how I organized my Obsidian vault:

ObsidianVault/
├── 01_Weekly/          # Weekly planners with goals and tasks
├── 02_Learning/        # Notes on DevOps, Linux, etc.
├── 03_Projects/        # Project documentation
├── 04_Templates/       # Templates for weekly planning
├── 05_Resources/       # Saved links, articles, tips
├── 06_Daily/           # Daily notes and reflections
└── Dashboard.md        # Vault homepage

🗓️ Weekly Planner Template

Inside `04_Templates/weekly-planner-template.md`, I use a simple markdown template for planning:

# 🗓️ Week 1 (1 Sept - 7 Sept)

## 🎯 Goals for the Week
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3

## ✅ Weekly Tasks

| Day       | Task               | Status |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|
| Monday    |                    | 🔲     |
| Tuesday   |                    | 🔲     |
| ...       |                    |        |
